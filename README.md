:sparkles: Welcome everyone to my profile, my name is Rym Oualha. 

I am a Junior ML Engineer interested in everything AI related with a strong background in Computer Science. 

I was also previously a Beta MLSA (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador).

<br>

- 🛰️ I’m currently working on extracting insights from Earth Observation data, combining Deep Learning with Remote Sensing to tackle real-world challenges.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAX

- 💬 Feel free to ask me about the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Program
  
- ⚡ Fun Fact: When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me deep in the Harry Potter 🪄 universe—rereading the books, debating the best spells, or proving why Gryffindor is the ultimate house 🦁🔥. Bravery, daring, and a bit of reckless curiosity? Sounds a lot like tackling complex ML challenges!
